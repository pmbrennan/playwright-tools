playwright-tools
================

Fast, easy creation of properly formatted stage play text. This package allows a playwright to quickly write and annotate plain text with a few easy to type tags, which are subsequently transformed into proper stage play format.

The best documentation for the package can be found in the PlaywrightToolsCode.bas file, which also contains all the BASIC code contained inside the PlaywrightToolsTemplate.odt file. Since the ODT file contains the styles referenced in the code, it is the best platform with which to use the code, although you are also encouraged to use the code into your own files and define your own styles for it to manipulate.
